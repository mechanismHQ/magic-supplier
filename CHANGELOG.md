## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- e3c2e88: The Magic Protocol supplier codebase has been updated to work with version 2 of the Magic Protocol. The supplier is now compeletely segwit-native, allowing for greatly reduced fees.

### Patch Changes

- 1af9c4c: Better backoff and retry logic for some worker jobs:

  - The balances job runs less often (now every 5 minutes)
  - The `finalize` jobs retry every 10 minutes, and retry for more instances, to account for expected block times and confirmation delays

  Various small fixes regarding code quality:

  - Instead of checking for `undefined` with `typeof val === 'undefined'`, added `isNullish` and `isNotNullish` helpers that check against `null` and `undefined`
  - Removed unused imports and variables

- 18b2dc6: Added more explicit retry logic for finalizing inbound and outbound transactions.
- 8f3a252: Changed the logic for fetching recent bridge events to safely exit if it detects a chain-state change while fetching events. This prevents any race conditions from preventing the supplier from properly handling events.
